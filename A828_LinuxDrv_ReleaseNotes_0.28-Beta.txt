1. Scope

This document provides guidelines on using AVerTV USB Hybrid+FM driver
installer. The main purpose of the installer is to help user install
driver for the running kernel. If you reboot to another kernel or upgrade
your kernel, the installer should be executed again to install
driver for the new kernel.

The following products are supported by the installer:

    1. AVerTV Hybrid+FM Volar (A828)


1.1 Supported Distributions

This version of driver installer supports kernel 2.6.17~2.6.31.
Most distributions with these kernel versions are supported.
If you kernel falls outside this range, the installer will still
try to install the most suitable version.

The following distributions, with their stock kernel, are officially 
tested and supported:

    1. Open SuSE Linux 10.3
    2. Mandriva Linux 2008
    3. Fedora Core Release 6
    4. Fedora Core Release 7
    5. Ubuntu 7.10
    6. Ubuntu 8.10
    7. Ubuntu 9.04
    8. Ubuntu 9.10
    9. Mandriva Linux 2009

Currently, only X86 and X86_64 architectures are supported. Other architectures
such as ARM, MIPS, PPC and etc. are not yet supported.

2. Requirement

If you customize your own kernel, make sure to enable support for DVB, Video
For Linux, and USB in the kernel configuration. General users can safely skip
this section.


3. Feedback & Support

Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome. If you have any question
not answered by this document or have any suggestions regarding our product
or driver, please contact AVerMedia support desk at the following website:

http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/Support/ContactSupport.aspx

It would help if you can provide /tmp/A828-install.log, which is
generated by the installer. It contains much detailed information regarding 
your system and how installer operates. 	


4. Known Issues

    I.  Unable to support Ubuntu 8.04 kernels. Users of Ubuntu 8.04 are
        recommended to upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 or build their own kernel.

    II. Driver fails to install or load, if user upgraded ALSA drivers
        from alsa-driver source packages.

    III. Only V4L2 applications are supported. V4L applications such as XawTV
        are not supported and can not work with our driver.
